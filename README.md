A repository for my dissertation: Real Time Distributed Computing On Network Nodes.

The aim of this project is to investigate the viability of moving part or all of the capabilities of datacenter network security appliances on the datacenter's network infrastructure itself. Typically, all network security related tasks such as Firewalling, Intrusion Detection and Antivirus are deployed on separate machines that are located at pre-defined places within a datacenter topology and are built for that specific task only. The project aims to research on the concept of deploying the same capabilities on the network infrastructure of the datacenter such as switches and routers. In order to do this a prototype system that is capable of performing basic firewalling and intrusion detection should be developed but this system should be distributed rather than running on a single machine. After the system is built its evaluation will consist of two stages. The performance evaluation will be executed using real world internet traffic routed through the system while monitoring the rate at which packets are processed. The efficiency evaluation will involve routing anomalous traffic through the prototype system and measuring the detection rate.
