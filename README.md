A repository for my dissertation: Real Time Distributed Computing On Network Nodes.

The aim of this project is to investigate the viability of moving part or all of the capabilities of network security appliances 
within a datacenter topology (that are typically located on separate machines) on the network infrastructure itself. 
This project also tries to leverage the concept of Software Defined Networking to allow dynamic configuration of the 
whole system and its behaviour.

By creating a proof-of-concept distributed system that has similar capabilities to a commercially available 
intrusion detection system and deploying it in a spanning tree topology, similar to a typical datacenter topology we can evaluate
its performance and scalability. 

The system is based on Apache Storm which provides a powerful real-time continuous computation system that is easily
configurable and very flexible.
